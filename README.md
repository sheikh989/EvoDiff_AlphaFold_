# Protein Sequence Design & Structure Prediction with EvoDiff + ColabFold
This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook workflow for protein sequence design and structure prediction using EvoDiff and ColabFold, with support for AlphaFold models and interactive 3D structure visualization.

## ðŸš€ Features
Environment Setup â€“ Installs all required dependencies for EvoDiff, PyTorch Geometric, and ColabFold.

Protein Sequence Generation â€“ Uses EvoDiff for designing new protein sequences.

Structure Prediction â€“ Runs AlphaFold models via ColabFold to predict protein structures.

Visualization â€“ Interactive 3D molecular visualization with Py3Dmol.

Batch Processing â€“ Supports running predictions for multiple sequences.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
cd yourrepo
If running in Google Colab, dependencies will be installed automatically when executing the notebook.

## ðŸ§¬ Usage
Open the Notebook
Launch EvoDiff_AlphaFold.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.

Run the Setup Cells
This installs EvoDiff, ColabFold, and visualization tools.
